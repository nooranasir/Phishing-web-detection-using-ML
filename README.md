This project detects phishing websites using Machine Learning.  
It is built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Google Colab.

## Features
- Logistic Regression, SVM, RandomForest models
- Input a URL and get prediction (phishing / legitimate)
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC

## How to Run
1. Open \`main.ipynb\` in Google Colab
2. Upload dataset \`5.urldata.csv\`
3. Run cells to preprocess, train and test
4. Use the input cell to enter a URL and get prediction

## Dataset
The dataset contains labeled URLs: legitimate (0) and phishing (1).
